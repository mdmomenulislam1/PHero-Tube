            Discuss the scope of var, let, and const
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
            <p class="text-justify">In JavaScript, var, let, and const are ways to create variables. The key differences lie in their scope
                and mutability. var has broader scope, potentially causing issues, and is hoisted with its declaration
                but not its assignment. It can be reassigned. let and const are block-scoped, meaning they're limited to
                where they're defined, and they're hoisted but not usable until declared. let can be reassigned, while
                const cannot be reassigned after its initial value is assigned, although the content of objects and
                arrays declared with const can still be modified. To keep code clean, it's advisable to prefer let for
                variables that might change and const for variables that should remain constant. Using var is generally
                discouraged due to its potential for unexpected behavior.</p>

            Tell us the use cases of null and undefined
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
            <p class="text-justify">Here's a concise paragraph explaining the use cases of null and undefined in JavaScript:

                In JavaScript, null and undefined are both used to represent the absence or lack of a value, but they
                have distinct purposes. undefined is automatically assigned to variables that are declared but not
                initialized, returned by functions with no explicit return value, and indicates missing object
                properties or function arguments. It's often used to signify unintentional absence. On the other hand,
                null is deliberately assigned to indicate an intentional absence of value or to clear a variable's
                content. It serves as a placeholder when you want to represent an empty state. Understanding their
                differences helps in effectively managing missing or empty data in your code.</p>

            What do you mean by REST API?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
            <p class="text-justify">A REST API, which stands for "Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface," is a
                framework for designing and creating web services that facilitate communication between different
                software applications over the internet. REST APIs are employed to enable interactions between
                client-side applications, like web or mobile apps, and server-side resources such as databases or
                services. They adhere to a set of principles, including being stateless, resource-centric, and utilizing
                standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to manipulate resources. By following a uniform
                interface, REST APIs provide a separation between client and server concerns, allowing for more modular
                development. These APIs commonly use formats like JSON or XML to transfer data and are known for their
                simplicity, scalability, and widespread adoption in various programming environments.</p>
